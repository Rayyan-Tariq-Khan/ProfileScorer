**Try the guided demo >** [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github.com/Rayyan-Tariq-Khan/ProfileScorer/blob/main/ProfileScorer_Demo.ipynb)


# ProfileScorer
Score single, and multiple (complex) abundance profiles

## Input formats
The Abundance sheet exemplifying the input format is provided in the Input folder-

**Abundances.tsv** - This is the main input file. First column should have Protein IDs and rest of the column representing gel slices should have serially numbered headers.

## How to Run

The workbook was originally scripted in Colab. Simply create an appropriately labelled folder in Google Drive, upload the notebook and then upload the input file (for eg- the sample input file) directly into the session using Files>Upload to session storage.

The notebook may also be used in other Python notebook environments (eg- Jupyter or Anaconda notebook).

## Citation

The input dataset is [PXD037757](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD037757) (van der Ven et al., 2023) published on the Proteome Exchange database. For the full publication, check out the citation below-
